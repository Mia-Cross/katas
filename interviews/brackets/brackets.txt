Have the function MultipleBrackets(str) take the str parameter being passed and
return 1 #ofBrackets if the brackets are correctly matched and each one is accounted for.
Otherwise return 0.
If str contains no brackets return 1.

For example:
“(hello [world])(!)“    output should be 1 3
because all the brackets are matched and there are 3 pairs of brackets
“((hello [world])”      output should be 0
because the brackets do not correctly match up.
Only “(”, “)”, “[”, and “]” will be used as brackets.
